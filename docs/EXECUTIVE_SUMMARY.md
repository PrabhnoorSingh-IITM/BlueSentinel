## 🎯 Problem & Solution

### The Problem

- **Invisible Threats**: Acidification and low oxygen zones are often invisible until fish kills occur.
- **Delayed Data**: Traditional sampling takes days.
- **Data Overload**: Raw sensor data is hard for policymakers to interpret.

### Our Solution

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: A "Glassmorphic" command center for instant visibility.
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Translates complex sensor data into plain-English health reports and remediation advice.
- **3D Global View**: Visualizes incidents on an interactive 3D globe for geographic context.

## 🚀 Key Innovations 

### 1. **AI-Powered "SentinelBuddy"**

- Uses **Google Gemini** to analyze sensor trends.
- Provides context-aware advice (e.g., "pH dropping rapidly: potential acid runoff").
- "Chat with your Ocean" feature allowing natural language queries.

### 2. **3D Geospatial Logs**

- Replaced 2D maps with **Globe.gl**.
- Interactive, rotating Earth visualization showing incident clusters.
- "Dark Mode" topology for high-contrast alert visibility.

### 3. **Mac-Style Floating Dock**

- Intuitive, magnificent navigation experience.
- Enhances usability for non-technical users.

## 📊 Technical Excellence

### Architecture

- **Edge**: ESP32 with 5 sensors (Temp, pH, Turbidity, DO, Salinity).
- **Cloud**: Firebase Realtime Database (<100ms latency).
- **AI**: Gemini 3 Pro for rapid inference.

### Impact

- **Cost**: <$100 per sensor node vs $5000+ industrial buoys.
- **Scalability**: Stateless serverless architecture.
