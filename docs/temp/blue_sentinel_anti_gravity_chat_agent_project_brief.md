# BlueSentinel — Full System Explanation

## Project Overview
BlueSentinel is a river intelligence and environmental monitoring platform designed to sense, analyze, and communicate real-time water pollution data through an integrated IoT and AI-driven web ecosystem.

The platform combines embedded sensing hardware, cloud data pipelines, machine learning analytics, and awareness infrastructure into a unified monitoring system for inland water bodies.

## Core Mission

• Enable continuous river health monitoring 
• Detect pollution indicators early 
• Build environmental datasets 
• Apply AI-driven interpretation 
• Support awareness and response coordination

---

## Hardware Layer

Deployed prototype sensing node built on ESP32 capturing:

• Water Temperature 
• Water pH 
• Turbidity

Data is transmitted to Firebase Realtime Database at fixed intervals.

---

## Intelligence Layer

Machine learning models process sensor data and simulated environmental datasets to estimate:

• Dissolved Oxygen 
• Salinity 
• Nitrogen & Nitrates 
• Ammonia 
• Lead & Heavy Metals 
• Sodium & Other Contaminants

These indicators are displayed as ML-estimated values.

## Platform Interfaces

• Live monitoring dashboard 
• Historical telemetry logs 
• Pollution alert tracking 
• Environmental news aggregation 
• NGO collaboration forums 
• AI chatbot assistant

---

## System Vision

BlueSentinel functions as a digital nervous system for rivers — sensing environmental changes, interpreting pollution signals, and enabling coordinated awareness and response.
